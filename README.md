# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Create a mobile application in react native. 

## The problem
I started out with fun ideas. When I was not limited by my limited knowledge, either the chosen API's were unstable or I was not granted access.
I changed projects every other day, nothing seemed to work. 
Installation of the different packages coupled with the many many errors in production were quite difficult to handle. Time was slipping again.
Beyond messy from following different threads/tutorials thinking I would gain time. 
Limitations: camera.


## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
